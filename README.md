🚀 CivicLens – A Government Transparency & Civic Engagement Platform

📌 Version: 1.0
📌 Last Updated: MM/DD/YYY

📌 What is CivicLens?

CivicLens is an open-source civic tech platform designed to empower citizens, increase government transparency, and hold politicians accountable through real-time legislative tracking, public polling, and data-driven insights.

In today’s political landscape, many citizens feel disconnected from the legislative process. CivicLens aims to bridge that gap by making policy and government decisions more accessible, understandable, and interactive.

✅ Key Features

📜 Bill Tracking & Summaries – AI-generated, plain-language summaries of upcoming legislation.

🗳️ Public Voting on Bills – Allows citizens to express their stance and compare results with politicians' votes.

💰 Pork Spending Tracker – Detects unnecessary or hidden government expenditures.

🔍 Politician Accountability Dashboard – Shows how often elected officials vote in alignment with public opinion.

🔒 Secure Hybrid Vote Storage – Uses blockchain hashing & encrypted databases to ensure data integrity.


CivicLens is not just a tech project—it’s a civic movement. 🚀

📌 Why Open Source?

CivicLens is built as an open-source project to ensure transparency, security, and public trust. Anyone can contribute, review, or improve the platform. Our goal is to create a community-driven tool for civic engagement that belongs to the people.
