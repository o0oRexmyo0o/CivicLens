## **📌 How CivicLens Influences Legislation**  
CivicLens doesn’t just **track government actions**—it **mobilizes people to change them.**  

### **📌 Phase 1: Public Awareness & Pressure (Before a Bill is Voted On)**  
✅ **Real-time bill tracking** – AI flags bad bills & corporate influence.  
✅ **Public voting** – Users vote on bills, creating a **public record of support/opposition.**  
✅ **Direct pressure tools** – Users can email, call, or message representatives with pre-filled talking points.  
✅ **Politician Influence Alerts** – CivicLens exposes when politicians vote against public interest after receiving corporate money.  

### **📌 Phase 2: Direct Intervention After a Bad Vote (Before It Becomes Law)**  
✅ **Tracking bill progression** – CivicLens follows bills from House → Senate → President.  
✅ **Amplifying media attention** – Large-scale public opposition gets media coverage.  
✅ **Watchdog partnerships** – CivicLens works with civic groups to put **legal & political pressure** on lawmakers.  

### **📌 Phase 3: Repealing or Amending a Bad Law (After It Passes)**  
✅ **Tracking real-world effects** – If a bad law passes, CivicLens **documents its impact.**  
✅ **Election accountability** – Users see which politicians voted for harmful laws.  
✅ **Public petitions & grassroots mobilization** – CivicLens organizes **repeal campaigns.**  

🔥 **Every stage ensures politicians feel public pressure and are held accountable.**
